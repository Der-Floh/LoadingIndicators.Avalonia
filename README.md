**`LoadingIndicators.Avalonia`** is an adaptation for Avalonia of the [LoadingIndicators.WPF](https://github.com/zeluisping/LoadingIndicators.WPF) collection of animated loading indicators. It provides 11 ready-to-use animated spinner styles as a single `LoadingIndicator` control.

## Installation

```sh
dotnet add package LoadingIndicators.Avalonia.New
```

**Requirements**: .NET Standard 2.0 or later (Avalonia 11.x), or .NET 8.0 or later (Avalonia 12.x+).

## Key Features

- **11 Built-in Animation Styles**: Choose from Arc, ArcEase, ArcGrow, Arcs, ArcsRing, DoubleBounce, FlipPlane, Pulse, Ring, ThreeDots, and Wave.
- **Easy Activation**: Toggle the indicator on and off with the `IsActive` property.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control animation speed independently of other UI elements via `SpeedRatio`.
- **Customisable Stroke**: Adjust line thickness for arc-based styles with the `Thickness` property.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on all platforms supported by Avalonia (Windows, macOS, Linux, Browser, Mobile).
- **Compiled Bindings**: Uses Avalonia compiled bindings by default for improved performance.

## Getting Started

### Setup

Add the styles to `App.axaml` so all `LoadingIndicator` controls in your application can resolve their themes:

```xml
<Application.Styles>
    <FluentTheme />
    <StyleInclude Source="avares://LoadingIndicators.Avalonia/LoadingIndicators.axaml" />
</Application.Styles>
```

### Basic Usage

Place a `LoadingIndicator` in any view and bind `IsActive` to your view-model's busy flag:

```xml
<LoadingIndicator IsActive="{Binding IsBusy}" Mode="Arcs" />
```

Optionally adjust speed and thickness:

```xml
<LoadingIndicator IsActive="{Binding IsBusy}" Mode="Arc" SpeedRatio="1.5" Thickness="4" />
```

| `SpeedRatio` | `double`               | `1.5`   | Multiplier for the animation speed (1.0 = normal speed) |
| `Thickness`  | `double`               | `4`     | Stroke thickness used by arc-based animation styles     |

### Available Modes

| Mode           | Description                                                                                  |

| `ArcEase`      | A short quarter-arc spinning around a faint full-circle track with cubic ease-in-out easing  |

| `DoubleBounce` | Two overlapping circles that simultaneously scale in opposite directions                     |
| `FlipPlane`    | A rectangle that alternately collapses vertically then horizontally, simulating a plane flip |
| `Pulse`        | A circle that expands from nothing while fading out, creating a ripple effect                |
| `Ring`         | Small dots arranged in a circle that pulse in and out in sequence                            |
